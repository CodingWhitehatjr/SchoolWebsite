        <p id="text">Campus life at Yale begins with the residential college. Yale's students are encouraged to study any subject and participate in any activity that interests them: arts, athletics, undergraduate organizations, political organizations, print and online publications, etc. Yale University has a total undergraduate enrollment of 6,092, with a gender distribution of 49% male students and 51% female students. At this school, 84% of the students live in college-owned, -operated or -affiliated housing and 16% of students live off campus. In sports, Yale University is part of the NCAA I. Home to about 5,964 undergraduates in 2019, Yale is a large, private university located in New Haven, Connecticut. This urban setting might be best suited for students who like the fast-paced city life. Should you tire of the campus however, Yale offers a "study abroad" program. Please note, some classes/degrees offered by Yale can be taken "online" so keep that in mind when reviewing this report. For more context, you might also check out our Yale Guide to Distance and Online Learning. For students with young families, Yale does offer some day care. Programs like this are often in very high demand, so be sure to inquire as soon as you can.</p>
